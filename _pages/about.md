* My name is Tianxu Wang, I have completed my master degree in June 2023 from Anhui University and Hefei Institute of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, majoring in material science.
* My research direction is **Controlled synthesis of hafnium boride ultra-high temperature ceramic powders**, based on this thesis, I participated in a significant national project and published a SCI paper, on this account, I’ve gained national scholarship of People's Republic of China. 
* Past experience: During my research period, critical thinking and rigorous work style have been well developed in the lab under the supervision of my mentor, Prof. Hu Xiaoye. As a student of research group, I studied ceramic powder synthesis under my mentor’s supervision and design feasible experimental scheme independently. Meanwhile, as a main participant of research project, I am involved in the mass production of HfB2 nano powder. In order to enhance efficiency, I investigated appropriate tool and improved a process of production. Besides, I also studied and skilled used various characterization methods such as XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, TGA-DSC, NMR, XPS, etc. This experience solidified my desire to pursue a career in research.
* Future research interests: Thermal management materials are my research interest, including UHTC, high heat conductivity carbon materials and composite materials, etc. The research of ceramic powder is limited, thus I would like to pursue a further study and long for a deeper understanding of the application of ceramic powder, for instance, composite ceramic, coating, etc. Thermal coating materials and composite materials prepared by UHTC powder exhibit an extraordinary performance of thermal resistance, hardness and other physical and chemical properties. Therefore, UHTC is a promising material used in thermal protection in aerospace, which is a challenging direction I’d like to choose.
