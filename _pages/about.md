* I am currently in my final year at the University of Manchester (UoM), majoring in Psychology (Hons). My research interests are primarily focused on **cognitive neuroscience, pain, and emotions**. Over the past couple of years, I have consistently ranked within the top 1% of my cohort of over 400 people and have maintained a High First Degree.
* In addition to my academic accomplishments, I have gained extensive experience working in research labs. This experience has provided me with proficiency in a variety of skills, including **participants recruitment, data collection, literature review, manuscripts preparation and presentations**. My toolkit includes E-Prime, SPSS, Qualtrics and Momentary Ecological Assessment.
* Beyond my studies, I am passionate about supporting **underrepresented** groups. I have been an active member of the Under-represented Student Perspective Panel at UoM for two years, and I devote my spare time to supporting the local LGBTQ+ community.
* I am set to graduate in 2024 and am currently **seeking a PhD position starting from the fall of 2024**.
