## Lab of Institute of Solid State Physics

2021.09 - Current

**Supervisor**: Prof. Xiaoye Hu, Institute of Solid State Physics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS

**Project: High Purity Ceramic Powder Mass Production**

In order to further explore the vast universe, reusable aerospace craft which used in extreme environment has become a hot research topic due to their characteristics of reducing transportation costs, improving carrying capacity and launching frequency. During hypervelocity flight and atmospheric reentry, the aircraft will generate severe friction with the atmosphere, resulting in a rapid rise in temperature on its surface. Therefore, developing and developing a special material that is resistant to high temperatures, oxidation resistance, and can maintain mechanical and chemical stability at high temperatures has become the key to the further development of modern hypersonic aircraft. Ultra high temperature ceramics (UHTC) have become the most promising candidate material for manufacturing aerospace craft due to their extremely high melting point and their ability to maintain mechanical and chemical stability at high temperatures.

In this project, I’m concentrated on **how to control the morphology and particle size of ceramic powder**, in order to obtain the stabilize route and process of mass production of ceramic powder. Besides, I also found that how a novel structure effected the performance of ceramic powder. In this case, I’ve published an article in Applied Surface Science, moreover, the first draft of the current work has been completed.
